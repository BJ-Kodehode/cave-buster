# Security Best Practices Checklist

## ✅ Implemented Security Measures

### 🔐 Environment Variables
- [x] `.env*` files are in `.gitignore`
- [x] Separate public/secret Clerk keys
- [x] MongoDB URI not exposed in client code
- [x] No hardcoded secrets in codebase

### 🛡️ Authentication & Authorization
- [x] Clerk authentication properly configured
- [x] Server-side auth checks in API routes
- [x] User ownership validation for CRUD operations
- [x] Proper session management

### 📝 Input Validation
- [x] Zod schemas for all API inputs
- [x] Type-safe data validation
- [x] Sanitized user inputs
- [x] Proper error messages without data leakage

### 🌐 API Security
- [x] Proper HTTP status codes (401, 403, 404, 409, 500)
- [x] Error handling without information disclosure
- [x] Rate limiting considerations (Clerk handles this)
- [x] CORS properly configured

### 🗄️ Database Security
- [x] MongoDB connection pooling/caching
- [x] No direct DB access from client
- [x] Proper data sanitization
- [x] Schema validation at DB level

## 🔄 Continuous Security

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Update dependencies regularly (`npm audit`)
- [ ] Monitor Clerk dashboard for suspicious activity
- [ ] Review MongoDB access logs
- [ ] Rotate secrets periodically

### Deployment Security
- [ ] Use environment-specific secrets
- [ ] Enable HTTPS only in production
- [ ] Configure proper CORS for production domains
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting

## 📊 Security Scan Results Summary

Based on automated scan:
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets found
- ✅ Proper `.gitignore` configuration
- ✅ Environment variables properly documented
- ✅ Type-safe validation with Zod
- ✅ Appropriate HTTP status codes
- ✅ MongoDB connection optimization

## 🚨 Action Items

1. **Development**: Continue using development keys safely
2. **Pre-Production**: Set up production Clerk instance
3. **Production**: Use production environment variables
4. **Monitoring**: Set up error tracking (Sentry/similar)
